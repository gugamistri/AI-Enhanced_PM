## Key Terms and Concepts

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The field of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and perception.

### Machine Learning (ML)
A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. Example: Email spam filters that adapt to new threats.

### Deep Learning
A branch of machine learning using neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data. Example: Image recognition in medical diagnostics.

### Large Language Model (LLM)
A type of AI model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Example: ChatGPT, GPT-4.

### Explainability
The degree to which the internal mechanics of an AI system can be understood and interpreted by humans. Important for trust and compliance.

### Bias
Systematic errors in AI outputs caused by imbalanced or prejudiced training data. Example: Facial recognition systems performing poorly on underrepresented groups.

### Overfitting
When a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Example: A model that predicts perfectly on historical sales but fails on future trends.

### Underfitting
When a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance.

### Supervised Learning
A machine learning approach where models are trained on labeled data. Example: Classifying emails as spam or not spam.

### Unsupervised Learning
A machine learning approach where models find patterns in unlabeled data. Example: Customer segmentation.

### Reinforcement Learning
A type of machine learning where agents learn by receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken in an environment. Example: AI playing chess or optimizing supply chains.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
AI techniques for understanding and generating human language. Example: Voice assistants, sentiment analysis.

### Computer Vision
AI methods for interpreting and processing visual information from the world. Example: Automated quality inspection in manufacturing.

### Model Drift
The phenomenon where an AI model's performance degrades over time due to changes in data or environment.

### Data Governance
Policies and processes for managing data quality, privacy, and security throughout the AI lifecycle.

## Common Acronyms
- **AI:** Artificial Intelligence
- **ML:** Machine Learning

## Tips to Avoid Common Confusions
- Don't use "AI" and "ML" interchangeably—ML is a subset of AI.
- "Bias" in AI refers to data or model errors, not personal prejudice.
- "Explainability" is different from "transparency"—a model can be transparent (open source) but not easily explainable.
