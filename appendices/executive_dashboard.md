# Executive Dashboard: Key Decision Points

## Strategic Assessment: Where Does Your Organization Stand?

**Immediate Diagnostic Questions:**
- Are you achieving measurable business impact from AI investments, or demonstrating technical capabilities without competitive advantage?
- Do you have systematic frameworks for moving from pilot to production, or collection of successful experiments?
- Is AI enhancing customer relationships and market position, or creating technology sophistication without customer value?

**The 90/8/2 Rule:**
- **90% of organizations**: Trapped in pilot mode with limited business impact
- **8% of organizations**: Achieving production scale with measurable competitive advantages  
- **2% of organizations**: Building sustainable market leadership through systematic AI transformation

**Your immediate goal**: Move from the 90% to the 8% through systematic implementation
