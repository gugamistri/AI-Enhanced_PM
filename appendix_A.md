## 1. Maturity Assessment Frameworks

### 1.1 McKinsey AI Maturity Model
- **Foundational:** Ad hoc AI pilots, limited executive sponsorship, fragmented data.
- **Emerging:** Defined AI strategy, initial data infrastructure, some cross-functional teams.
- **Integrated:** AI embedded in business processes, robust data governance, executive buy-in.
- **Transformational:** AI at scale, continuous learning, measurable business impact, board-level oversight.
