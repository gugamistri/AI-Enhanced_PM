# Appendix C: AI Scenario Planning and Risk Management Playbook

## Introduction

This playbook equips organizations to anticipate, plan for, and mitigate the risks associated with AI transformation. Drawing on scenario planning frameworks from Shell, McKinsey, and leading risk experts, it provides actionable tools for strategic foresight and risk management.

---

## 1. Scenario Planning Frameworks

### 1.1 Shell Scenario Planning Model
- Define key drivers of change (technology, regulation, market)
- Develop plausible future scenarios (optimistic, pessimistic, baseline)
- Stress-test strategies against each scenario

### 1.2 McKinsey AI Risk Assessment
- Identify risk domains: strategic, operational, regulatory, ethical
- Quantify likelihood and impact
- Develop mitigation and contingency plans

---

## 2. AI Risk Assessment Checklist
- [ ] Strategic alignment with business goals
- [ ] Data quality and bias risks
- [ ] Model explainability and transparency
- [ ] Regulatory compliance (GDPR, EU AI Act, etc.)
- [ ] Cybersecurity and data privacy
- [ ] Ethical considerations and stakeholder impact
- [ ] Incident response and crisis management plans

**Professional Tip:** "Scenario planning is not about predicting the future, but preparing for uncertainty." — Shell, 2023

## 3. Risk Matrix Template
| Risk Domain     | Likelihood (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Mitigation Actions         |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Strategic       |                  |              |                           |
| Operational     |                  |              |                           |
| Regulatory      |                  |              |                           |
| Ethical         |                  |              |                           |

**Instructions:** Score each risk, prioritize high-impact areas, and assign owners.

## 4. Example: Scenario Planning at Siemens
Siemens used scenario planning to prepare for regulatory changes in the EU AI Act, enabling proactive compliance and uninterrupted product launches (Siemens, 2023).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls and Expert Recommendations
- Don't ignore low-probability, high-impact risks
- Involve cross-functional teams in scenario planning
- Update scenarios regularly as the environment evolves
- Document lessons learned from risk events

**Sidebar:** "The best-prepared organizations treat risk management as a continuous process." — McKinsey, 2024
